The performance drop was noticed when switching from proprietary fglrx to new free AMD videocard driver.

It all comes from new Ubuntu release that doesnt support "old warm" proprietary fglrx.

There was a publications and according to them there were some patches for AMD videodrivers.

As far as I am using fglrx in Linux mint 17.3 it is a great opportunity to check if there is big changes with these patches before moving to Kubuntu 16.10.

I will measure fps in two games as far as I have only them in my Steam service.

While games are downloading and Kubuntu flash drive is being prepared :

- "But why Kubuntu ?"

I'll answer : 

1. KDE is facing significant improvements in graphic design.

2. I have an optimism that developers know about past performance issues and are making progress in this field too.

3. KDE is based on C++ language and Qt framework, which are familiar for me, so, professional interest drives me.

4. I want to check whether community really made progress in free AMD driver development. 


I want to point out that I had a bad experience using KDE, but I assume that it was connected with HDD problems.

All these points will be checked, stay tuned.
