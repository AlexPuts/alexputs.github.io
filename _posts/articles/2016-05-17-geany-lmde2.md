After installation geany in lmde 2 I found that it isnt functioning properly, causing it to lack output in terminal after launching compiled program.

	geany file could not be opened

	(program exited with code:25)

It's resolved very easy. You just need to install gnome-terminal package and gnome-terminal-data package (which apt-get will resolve automatically).

Use this command:


```css
sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal
```

Now geany is ready to use.
