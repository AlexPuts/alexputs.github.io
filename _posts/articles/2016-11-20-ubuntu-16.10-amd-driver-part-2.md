In privous post "Ubuntu and amd driver for Kubuntu 16.10 part 1", I was questioning , if there was any improvements done to free AMD dirver since moving to new Ubuntu.

I'll remind that moving to new Ubuntu version was noted with switch from fglrx to new free amdgpu driver.


So, today we will compare these system with proprietary fglrx: 

* Linux mint 17.3, fglrx driver
* Kubuntu 16.10, free amdgpu driver


Note, that I wasnt using LTS based Kubuntu, so that I will have the most relevant driver.

I've been using steam purchased game to make the testing.

The native games are not widespread for Linux, so for testing only 2 games were used.

These are the games :

1. Pay Day 2. (computer game about bank robbery (FPS)) 

2. Darkest hour. (Red Orchestra mod game about second wold war (FPS))

The steam embedded FPS counter was used to measure FPS values, the FPS values were measured in the exact same game locations and points.

The computer hardware being used :

AMD Athlon II X4 645 @ 3.10 GHz, 4 Gb RAM, AMD HD 7950 MSI

And testing results are :

Note, that by my subject feelings the input lag is a bit more when using amdgpu driver.

The fglrx FPS values were greater than amdgpu just because amdgpu was limiting the upper bound of FPS values by 60 as far as my monitor have 60 Hz framerate.

Charts for values shown by both drivers are :

Conclusion :

Fglrx has greater FPS values only in menus and a bit better (less) input lag.

In other criterias the FPS shown by drivers are pretty close, so I think that its acceptable to move on to new system with amdgpu free driver.
